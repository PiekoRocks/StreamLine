## Overview
Our **StreamLine** application is designed to manage data for over **5,000 fire hydrants** across urban, suburban, and rural areas. Fire hydrants require **regular maintenance**, including inspections and repairs performed by field workers. 

To ensure operational efficiency and **make it easier to keep hydrants working for emergencies**, hydrant status must be tracked, allowing field workers to **prioritize tasks effectively**.

### **The Problem**
Most hydrant information is stored in **multiple systems** (spreadsheets, handwritten logs, legacy software), making it challenging to access **reliable and comprehensive** hydrant data.

### **The Solution**
StreamLine serves as a **centralized hub** for hydrant data, consolidating:
- **Unique IDs** – Each hydrant is assigned a distinct identifier for accurate record-keeping.
- **Locations** – Real-time GPS coordinates ensure easy hydrant identification and mapping.
- **Hydrant Types** – Categorization of hydrants based on specifications and capacity.
- **Maintenance Logs** – Detailed records of past and upcoming maintenance activities.
- **Inspection History** – Tracks inspection status, ensuring compliance with safety standards.
